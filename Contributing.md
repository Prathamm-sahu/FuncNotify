# Contributing ⏰ 
> **How to Contribute**

#### Conribution Guide:
1. ⭐⭐ Give us a Star on GitHub ⭐⭐
2. Fork the repository into your account
3. Clone your repository into your working drive `git clone [url in green code dropdown]`
   a. Replace anything in `[anything]` in brackets
4. Please follow the instructions in `FuncNotify/TemplateMethod_.py` and add to `template.env` and create a new branch. Also let me know of any more credentials so I can add them to testing
   a. Just add a file called `[Method_Name]Method.py` and a decorator called `def time_[Method_Name]():`, and a `test_[Method_Name].py` for tests.
   b. Add any additional packages to `requirements.txt`, this allows me to dynamically track every package necessary so builds are easier
5. REACH OUT to me at `kevin.j@columbia.edu` for help or issues.

#### Abstract Class and Automated implementation:
Make sure any Class you must inherit from the Abstract Class `NotifyMethods` via `class [Method_Name]Method(NotifyMethods):`. Then implement the methods found in `TemplateMethod_.py` for the correct methods. Look at other files for the proper format.

All classes will automatically added to a dictionary that can be accessed with a string as a key `"[Method_Name]"`. Pass that string as an argument to get notified via that method.

#### Comments:
Try and write as detailed comments on **why** things happen. Try and write code that is self-explanatory, without too many comments. Try and keep the same format of docstrings for each new method. Check out this link for a VsCode extension to automatically create docstrings

#### Describe your changes well.
> **skim this git guide, you don't *really* have to follow lol**

The first line of the commit message should be a short description (50
characters is the soft limit, see DISCUSSION in git-commit(1)), and
should skip the full stop.  

* push: allow pushing to multiple remotes

* grep: allow passing in command-line arguments

If in doubt which identifier to use, run "git log --no-merges" on the
files you are modifying to see the current conventions.

The body should provide a meaningful commit message, which:

* explains the problem the change tries to solve, iow, what is wrong
  with the current code without the change.

* justifies the way the change solves the problem, iow, why the
  result with the change is better.

* alternate solutions considered but discarded, if any.

#### Testing:
Create a copy of the `template.env` and name it `.env` and fill it out with your full credentials for full scale testing.

For writing your own tests, create your own file called `test_[Method_Name].py` and create a class that inherits from TestGeneric `class Test[Method_name](TestGeneric)`. Implement the `@abstractmethods` according to the templates.
